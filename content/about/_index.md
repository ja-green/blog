Hey there. Thank you for visiting my website and showing your interest in my work.
My name is Jack, I'm a passionate Information Security enthusiast, tool author and lifelong learner.
I'm currently working as a Penetration Tester and Red Team Member in the UK
for one of the major woldwide banks.

This is my blog and personal website. I intend for this blog to be mainly focused
on information security content however I am also passionate about self-development,
so don't be surprised if you see that type of content here too.

In general, the kind of content you can expect to find here is:
 - CTF writeups
 - computer security and privacy content
 - software development

If youâ€™d like to talk please check out my contact page. There are a few ways to
contact me there including links to my social media pages. I'm generally not a fan
of social media so don't expect to find me in many places.

Thanks again for your interest and have a fantastic day.
