### Hello and welcome to my first blog post!

I am excited to begin blogging and share my learning experiences with you.
I love learning new things and improving my skills in security and programming.
It will be great to have you along with me and I hope you learn something
too! I tend to always have a personal project of some description the
go so it will be a fun experience to log my journey in completing each of them
(and hopefully keep me committed to completing them too!)

You can expect future posts to be a lot more technical than this one however I
may occasionally post a personal update depending on the direction this blog
ends up taking or if there is any demand for it.
As I mention briefly in my [about](/about/) page, I am a huge fan of
self-improvement so you can expect to find the occasional post about
that here too.

I hope you enjoy the posts to come! See you in the next one.
